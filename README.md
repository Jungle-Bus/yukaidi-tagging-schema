This is the directory of WDM tagging data used by the Yukaidi editor. 
It includes presets, fields, deprecations, and more.

### Making Changes

Documentation for the data formats is located with the [schema-builder](https://github.com/ideditor/schema-builder)
package, which is the technical basis of this project. To make a change, update a
file within the `data` folder and rebuild by running `npm run build` in your terminal.
